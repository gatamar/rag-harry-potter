# Project Interaction Rules
- Never run any git or git-related commands (e.g., git status, git add, git commit, git diff) in this workspace.
- Treat the repository as read-only from a version-control perspective; perform all tasks without invoking git.
- Do not modify `requirements.txt`; leave dependency management to the project owner.
